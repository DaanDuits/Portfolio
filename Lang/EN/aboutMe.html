                <section class="AboutMe">
                    <article id="aboutMe">My name is Daan Duits I am a 19 year old game development student at MediaCollege Amsterdam. I live in Oostzaan together 
                        with my parents and little brother.<br>
                        <br>
                        I started Game development when I was 16 years old and trying to make mods for people playground. I really wanted to learn more about
                        how games work behind the scenes and how they are made.<br>
                        <br>
                        I am looking for a professional and fun internship that works with Unity or an engine that works with C++. I like to work with C++ because it gives you alot of
                        freedom with using your computers memory which makes it alot harder too, right now I am trying to use it together with OpenGL to create my own game engine. 
                        When using Unity I like to work in a team and making more technical features like saving and loading, pathfinding and procedural generation.
