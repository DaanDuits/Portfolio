                  For the second quarter of my second year of school I worked at the XR-Lab HLE in Hilversum
                  together with 10 game art students and 11 game development students on a part of the VR shooter
                  After the fall made by Vertigo games. We had to do this in Unreal engine 5 instead of Unity in which After the fall is actually made with
                  While making the game we met 2 developers that worked on After the fall and learned about the bugs the found and struggles they hadden
                  while making the game.

                <h2>Working with Unreal Engine 5</h2>
                <div class="description-text">
                  During this quarter I worked with Unreal Engine for the first time. I did not use the C++ editor yet and used blueprints instead, I still learned alot about the engine
                  and its features. But I honestly don't really like the way alot of components are premade in great detail instead of Unity which activates you to create your own
                  components. However I still want to learn more about the engine and using its C++ editor.

                <h2>Zombie AI using unreal behaviour trees</h2>
                <div class="description-text">
                  The Unreal engine 5 behaviour trees are easy to use and learn. This behaviour tree handles the movement and atacking for the 
                  zombies in After the fall - vertical slice.
                  Every time the zombie walks somewhere he checks if he found the player if so he will go there and do his attack animation.
                  Sadly I lost the source project and thus acces to the code files I made. This is the only screesnhot I can find of the behaviour tree.
